v0.2.0 (2016-07-06)
===================

- Removed: `wpcalypso/no-lodash-import` rule dropped in favor of alternatives to enable optimized Lodash imports (see [Automattic/wp-calypso#6539](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/6539)). It's expected that this will be removed from `eslint-plugin-wpcalypso` in a future major release.
